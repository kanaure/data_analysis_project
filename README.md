Pokemon TCG Stats Analysis

This project analyzes the statistics of Pokémon from the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG). The goal is to compare the stats of Legendary vs non-Legendary Pokémon, explore correlations between different stats, and analyze the prevalence and strength of different Pokémon types.

Key Findings:
- Legendary Pokémon generally have higher stats than non-Legendary Pokémon, but some non-Legendary Pokémon are as strong as or stronger than the average Legendary.
- Significant correlation exists between Special Defence and Defence in Legendary Pokémon.
- Water-type Pokémon are the most common in the dataset.
- Dragon-type Pokémon have higher total stats than other types, with 99% confidence.
